# Scala lessons

This is a repository to help myself keep a track of my progress with scala and akka. Most of the times the 
need to learn a new language gets overshadowed by lack of time and proficiency in another. So I hope I can follow
my lesson plan here and eventually manage to be equally productive with newer languages.
