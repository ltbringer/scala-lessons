# Scala lessons
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ltbringer/scala-lessons)

This is a repository to help myself keep a track of my progress with scala and akka. Most of the times the 
need to learn a new language gets overshadowed by lack of time and proficiency in another. So I hope I can follow
my lesson plan here and eventually manage to be equally productive with newer languages.

# Lesson plans
(!) - I might know what this is, hence I might skip code-exercises but need to review for the sake of syntactical details.

(~) - I have learned the concept in another language, so code-exercises might not be needed.
